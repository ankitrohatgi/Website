<!-- New Development Machine! -->
<p>I had been using my 2011 Macbook Pro (i5, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD) for all my graduate work, personal work and all side projects since 2011. It is by far the best laptop I have ever owned and I will probably continue using it for next 3-4 years. However, for many of my side projects, I found myself installing a lot of opensource software that was originally developed for Linux. I was spending quite a lot of time trying to get things to work on the Mac, and often failing. Even for photo editing, I was not too happy when I realized that Apple had stopped paying attention to Aperture (I never really liked Adobe Lightroom). I think opensource Linux programs like Darktable are sufficient for my needs. After many months of compromizing with a Linux Virtual Machine in VirtualBox, I decided to build myself a dedicated Linux desktop.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://reddit.com/r/buildapc">buildapc subreddit</a> and <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a> were a huge help and after a couple of weeks of research, I was able to compile the final list of components. The assembly was easy as there are quite a few videos on Youtube explaining the process in every detail.</p>

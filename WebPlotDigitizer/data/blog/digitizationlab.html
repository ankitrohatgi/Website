<!-- Opensourcing digitization lab software -->

<p>
I had received some requests for a desktop deployment of WebPlotDigitizer and in the last few weeks, I had been exploring that possibility under a project name "DigitizationLab". After exploring many UI toolkits and programming languages, I have finally settled upon a Qt C++ code. It is still at a very initial stage, but I finally have some seed code that can be worked upon in the future. This project will also be distributed with an opensource license (GNU GPL Version 3) and is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ankitrohatgi/digitizationlab">https://github.com/ankitrohatgi/digitizationlab</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The aim is not just to recreate WebPlotDigitizer in a native application, but also to go beyond what is practically feasible in a web-based environment. Some possibilities that I can think of right now are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch process multiple images.</li>
<li>Save and re-use axes calibration and digitization data.</li>
<li>Read PDF documents and extract images automatically.</li>
<li>Image editing capabilities (transformations, filters etc.) and annotations.</li>
<li>Consume and share data from various database files or online resources.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Since this is also worked upon in my spare time, this will not receive full attention until I see some genuine interest in the project. The web-based application will continue being the priority until then. If you believe that DigitizationLab is something you would be interested in or have some suggestions, then feel free to drop me an email (ankitrohatgi@hotmail.com) or post on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/image-digitization">discussion forum</a>.</p>

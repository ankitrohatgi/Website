This will be kept as a "beta" for a couple of weeks just to make sure there aren't any issues that I might have overlooked. Also, this gives me some time to put together a few tutorials and update the user manual etc. Checkout the demo video in the previous post - it should help in getting started.

Feedback is highly appreciated!

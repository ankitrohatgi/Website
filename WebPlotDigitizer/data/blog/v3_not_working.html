I noticed that many browsers had cached a part of the older version and were trying to mix the cached part with the code from the new version. This will obviously result in problems as there are a significant number of differences between version 2.6 and 3.0.</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you have experienced any issues with version 3.0, then please try clearing your browser cache first. You can clear browser history for a specific website in most browsers.</p>

<p>
I have turned off browser caching for future sessions in the version 3.1 (just released). This will prevent issues in the future, but it will not help if you have a cache already.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Instructions to clear your cache: <a href="http://www.firefoxfacts.com/2010/03/17/clear-firefoxs-history-for-a-single-site/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/721692/google-chrome-clear-cache-for-specific-website">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4448839?tstart=0">Safari</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Sorry about the inconvenience. I am hoping that this will not be required for future releases (3.1+).

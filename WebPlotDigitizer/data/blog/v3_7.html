<p>Version 3.7 is out!</p>
<br/>
<p>This version contains a number of minor fixes - especially for Polar Diagrams. Also, now the exported JSON file also contains the actual digitized data instead of just the pixel locations of the points. To read a summary of changes, check out the <a href="http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/release_notes.txt">release notes</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>I have also been working on bar charts, grid removal and a Chrome Extension to allow opening any image on any webpage by simply right-clicking on it and selecting "Send to WebPlotDigitizer". Unfortunately, these features were not fully stable at the time of the release, so they have been disabled in this release.</p>

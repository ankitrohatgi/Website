WordPress had served this website very well for almost four years, but it was an overkill for such a simple static website like this. Having to keep track of MySQL backups and WordPress version updates is too much work to maintain the simple static pages here. Also the appearance and layout was not exactly in my full control.

This new website has been developed from scratch using <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org" target="_blank">Jinja2</a> templates. I compile the pages on my laptop using a Python script and upload the rendered HTML on the server. So now there is no need for a database server or any server side PHP scripts that WordPress needed. I am hoping that this results in a better experience and lower server load. I can also reuse these templates for my other projects quite easily.

<p>Also note that some of the older posts have been removed in the new website. I might restore some of those if I think they are still useful. The RSS feed is also temporarily down. A new feed should be available in the next couple of days.</p>

<!-- Projects availbale! -->
<p>
I have started adding descriptions of a few interesting projects related to WebPlotDigitizer on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/image-digitization">discussion forum</a>. These projects are free to be picked up by anyone who wishes to contribute. Even partial contributions will be highly appreciated. Many of these do not require the intimate knowledge of the WebPlotDigitizer code. Look for the posts with <b>[Available Project]</b> in the subject line. If you find something interesting then drop a line in the forum or email me personally. Also, feel free to add to the existing discussions or start something new.</p>

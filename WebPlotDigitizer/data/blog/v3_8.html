<p><b>R Package</b></p>
<br/>
<p>The obvious step after extracting data from images is to analyze or re-plot this data. R is an excellent tool for this purpose and I think it would be extremely useful if the users can run WebPlotDigitizer in a manner that allows real-time interaction with R. Also, since internet connectivity is not always practical, it makes a lot of sense to have an offline R package that can host WebPlotDigitizer locally.</p>

<p>With some <a href="https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/r-package-to-host-webplotdigitizer-locally-and-allow-live-interaction-with-data/183/8" target="_blank">guidance from rOpenSci</a>, I have started working on a R package for WebPlotDigitizer. The initial attempt (<a href="https://github.com/ankitrohatgi/wpd-R">GitHub</a>) looks promising:</p>
